Kruskals Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning tree

Input:

Characters (will represent each vertex)
Edges (indices of the verticies with their weights)

Output:
Minimum Spanning tree

Example:

Enter the vertex(character):
a
Enter the vertex(character):
b
Enter the vertex(character):
c
Enter the vertex(character):
d
Enter the edge and weight:
0
1
2
Enter the edge and weight:
0
2
2
Enter the edge and weight:
1
2
1
Enter the edge and weight:
1
3
5
Enter the edge and weight:
2
3
3
Minimum Spanning tree : 
bc 1
ab 2
cd 3
